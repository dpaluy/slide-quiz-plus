# slide-quiz

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/slide-quiz)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/slide-quiz)

Add live audience quizzes to your [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com) and [Slidev](https://sli.dev) presentations. Powered by [AnyCable](https://anycable.io).

**[Live Demo](https://slide-quiz-demo.netlify.app/)** — open the presenter view in one tab and the [audience page](https://slide-quiz-demo.netlify.app/quiz.html) on your phone.

## What You Get

You build a presentation deck with quiz slides, deploy it to the web, and present it. When you land on a quiz slide, your audience sees a QR code, scans it on their phones, and votes — results animate on your slides in real time.

- **Multiple-choice questions** with up to 4 options and live bar charts
- **Free-text questions** with live word cloud results
- **QR code** auto-generated on quiz and results slides so the audience can join or vote at any time
- **Live results** that update as votes come in (sub-second via WebSockets)
- **Participant counter** showing how many people are connected
- **Mobile-friendly voting page** — no app install, just a browser
- **Automatic question sync** — define questions once on your slides, the audience page receives them automatically
- **Theming** — inherits your presentation theme's fonts and colors automatically

## How It Works

Your presentation needs to be **deployed to the web** (not just opened locally) because the audience connects to it from their phones. The setup has three parts:

1. **AnyCable** — a managed WebSocket service that relays votes between the audience and your slides. The free tier supports up to **2,000 concurrent connections**, which is plenty for conference talks and meetups.

2. **Your presentation** — a static site (HTML + JS) deployed to **Netlify**, **Vercel**, or **Cloudflare Pages**. The plugin adds quiz UI to your slides automatically.

3. **Serverless functions** — 3 small files that run on your hosting platform. They receive answers from the audience and broadcast results via AnyCable. Secrets stay in environment variables, never in your code.

```

       │                           │                        │
       │                           │◄──── submit vote ──────┤
       │◄── broadcast results ─────┤     (serverless fn)    │
       │   update results           │                        │
```

Questions are defined once — as `data-quiz-*` attributes on your slides. The presenter broadcasts them to the audience page via the sync channel, so the participant widget doesn't need its own copy.

## Getting Started

There are two ways to set up: the **interactive CLI** (recommended) or **manual setup**.

Both follow the same steps:

1. Create a free AnyCable Plus app (provides the WebSocket infrastructure)
2. Scaffold your project with quiz slides (Reveal.js or Slidev)
3. Deploy to Netlify, Vercel, or Cloudflare Pages

### Option A: Interactive CLI (recommended)

One command that walks you through everything — creates your AnyCable app, scaffolds the project, and optionally deploys it:

```bash
npx create-slide-quiz
```

The CLI will:
1. Open [plus.anycable.io](https://plus.anycable.io) and guide you through creating an AnyCable app
2. Ask for your **WebSocket URL** and **Broadcast URL** (the two values AnyCable gives you)
3. Scaffold a complete project with quiz slides, audience page, and serverless functions
4. Install dependencies and initialize git
5. Deploy via platform CLI (if installed) or show manual deploy instructions

### Option B: Add to an existing Slidev presentation

If you already have a Slidev deck, install the addon and configure it in your frontmatter:

#### 1. Create an AnyCable Plus app

Same as above — sign in at [plus.anycable.io](https://plus.anycable.io), create a cable with an empty secret, and copy your URLs.

You can do that via the AnyCable+ CLI as follows:

```sh
curl -LSs https://anycable-plus.terminalwire.sh | bash

anycable-plus cable create my-slides-cable --public --wait

Cable my-slides-cable is being provisioned
...

ID              43
Name            my-slides-cable
Status          created
WebSocket URL   wss://my-slides-cable-sv7m.fly.dev/cable
Broadcast URL   https://my-slides-cable-sv7m.fly.dev/_broadcast
Secret          none (public mode)
```

#### 2. Install the addon

```bash
npm install slidev-addon-slide-quiz
```

#### 3. Configure slides.md

Add the addon and quiz config to your frontmatter:

```yaml
---
addons:
  - slidev-addon-slide-quiz
slideQuiz:
  wsUrl: wss://your-cable.anycable.io/cable
  quizGroupId: my-talk
  quizUrl: /quiz.html
---
```

For Vercel or Cloudflare Pages, also add custom endpoints:

```yaml
slideQuiz:
  wsUrl: wss://your-cable.anycable.io/cable
  quizGroupId: my-talk
  quizUrl: /quiz.html
  endpoints:
    answer: /api/quiz-answer
    sync: /api/quiz-sync
```

#### 4. Add quiz slides

```markdown
---
layout: quiz-results
quizId: q1
question: Where are you joining from?
options:
  - { label: A, text: San Francisco }
  - { label: B, text: New York }
  - { label: C, text: Europe, correct: true }
  - { label: D, text: Elsewhere }
---
```

For a free-text question (word cloud results), set `type: text` and omit `options`:

```markdown
---
layout: quiz-results
quizId: q2
question: What's your favorite framework?
type: text
---
```

> **Tip:** Use `layout: quiz` instead of `layout: quiz-results` if you want a separate question slide where the audience votes _before_ seeing results.

#### 5. Copy serverless functions and deploy

Copy the functions from the `slide-quiz` package and set `ANYCABLE_BROADCAST_URL` on your platform. See [functions/README.md](./functions/README.md) for details.

### Option C: Add to an existing Reveal.js presentation

If you already have a Reveal.js deck, you can add live quizzes to it manually.

#### 1. Create an AnyCable Plus app

You can do that via the AnyCable+ CLI as follows:

```sh
curl -LSs https://anycable-plus.terminalwire.sh | bash

anycable-plus cable create my-slides-cable --public --wait

Cable my-slides-cable is being provisioned
...

ID              43
Name            my-slides-cable
Status          created
WebSocket URL   wss://my-slides-cable-sv7m.fly.dev/cable
Broadcast URL   https://my-slides-cable-sv7m.fly.dev/_broadcast
Secret          none (public mode)
```

Alternatively, go to [plus.anycable.io](https://plus.anycable.io), create a new account with GitHub and:

1. Click **New Cable**, name it anything, pick **JavaScript** as your backend
2. On the Application secret screen, **clear the secret** (empty the input) — this enables public streams mode
3. After deploy, copy the **WebSocket URL** and **Broadcast URL**

#### 2. Install the plugin

```bash
npm install slide-quiz
```

#### 3. Wire up the plugin

Add two imports and the `slideQuiz` config to your existing `Reveal.initialize()` call:

```js
import RevealSlideQuiz from 'slide-quiz';
import 'slide-quiz/style.css';

// In your existing Reveal.initialize() call, add:
Reveal.initialize({
  plugins: [RevealSlideQuiz],  // add to your plugins array
  slideQuiz: {
    wsUrl: 'wss://your-cable.anycable.io/cable',   // ← from step 1
    quizGroupId: 'my-talk',
    quizUrl: `${window.location.origin}/quiz.html`,
  },
  // ...your existing config
});
```

`quizUrl` resolves dynamically — it will point to the right domain wherever you deploy.

#### 4. Add quiz slides

Add data attributes to your slides — the plugin injects all the UI automatically:

```html
<!-- Multiple-choice — audience sees live responses -->
<section data-quiz-results="q1"
         data-quiz-question="Where are you joining from?"
         data-quiz-options='[
           {"label":"A","text":"San Francisco"},
           {"label":"B","text":"New York"},
           {"label":"C","text":"Europe"},
           {"label":"D","text":"Elsewhere"}
         ]'>
</section>

<!-- Free-text question (word cloud results) -->
<section data-quiz-results="q2" data-quiz-type="text"
         data-quiz-question="What's your favorite framework?">
</section>
```

> **Tip:** Use `data-quiz-id` instead of `data-quiz-results` if you want a separate question slide where the audience votes _before_ seeing results.

`data-quiz-type` defaults to `"choice"` when omitted, so existing slides work without changes.

#### 5. Create the audience page

The audience needs a separate page to vote from their phones. Create a `quiz.html` and a script that mounts the participant widget:

```js
import {
  createParticipantUI,
  participantConfigFromUrlParams,
} from 'slide-quiz/participant';
import 'slide-quiz/participant.css';

const params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
const configFromUrl = participantConfigFromUrlParams(params);

createParticipantUI('#quiz-root', {
  wsUrl: configFromUrl.wsUrl || 'wss://your-cable.anycable.io/cable',
  quizGroupId: configFromUrl.quizGroupId || 'my-talk',
  endpoints: configFromUrl.endpoints,
});
```

That's it — questions are synced automatically from your presentation slides. No need to duplicate them here. If your QR code includes custom endpoints, this helper reads them automatically.

#### 6. Add serverless functions and deploy

Your presentation must be deployed — the audience needs to reach it from their phones.

Copy the serverless functions from `functions/netlify/`, `functions/vercel/`, or `functions/cloudflare/` into your project and set the required environment variables:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ANYCABLE_BROADCAST_URL` | Yes | Broadcast URL from step 1 |
| `ANYCABLE_BROADCAST_KEY` | No | Broadcast key (if your AnyCable app uses one) |

See [functions/README.md](./functions/README.md) for step-by-step deploy instructions for each platform.

## AnyCable Plus

This plugin uses [AnyCable Plus](https://plus.anycable.io) — a managed WebSocket service. The free tier includes:

- Up to **2,000 concurrent connections**
- Public streams mode (no backend auth needed)
- WebSocket + HTTP broadcast endpoints

### A note on public streams

By default, the plugin uses **public streams** — WebSocket messages are not authenticated. This means anyone who knows the channel name could technically observe or interact with the quiz data. For most use cases (conference talks, meetups, workshops) this is perfectly fine — quiz votes aren't sensitive.

If your votes are confidential or you need to restrict who can participate, see [Appendix: Authorized Streams](#appendix-authorized-streams).

## Configuration

### Plugin Options (`slideQuiz`)

| Option | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `wsUrl` | `string` | Yes | AnyCable WebSocket URL |
| `quizGroupId` | `string` | Yes | Unique ID grouping quizzes in this talk |
| `quizUrl` | `string` | No | Audience page URL (shown as QR code) |
| `endpoints` | `object` | No | Custom endpoint paths (default: `/.netlify/functions/*`) |
| `titleText` | `string` | No | Title shown on question slides (omitted by default) |

### Custom Endpoints

For Vercel or Cloudflare Pages, override the default Netlify paths:

```js
slideQuiz: {
  endpoints: {
    answer: '/api/quiz-answer',
    sync: '/api/quiz-sync',
  }
}
```

## Theming

The plugin inherits your Reveal.js theme's fonts and colors automatically via `--r-*` custom properties. Override `--sq-*` variables to fine-tune:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--sq-accent` | `var(--r-link-color, #f59e0b)` | Accent color (bar highlights, word cloud top word) |
| `--sq-text` | `var(--r-main-color, inherit)` | Main text color |
| `--sq-text-muted` | 50% of `--sq-text` | Secondary text |
| `--sq-font` | `var(--r-main-font, inherit)` | Body font |
| `--sq-heading-font` | `var(--r-heading-font, inherit)` | Heading font |
| `--sq-mono` | `var(--r-code-font, ...)` | Monospace font |
| `--sq-bar-fill` | 35% of `--sq-text` | Bar fill color |
| `--sq-bar-correct` | `var(--sq-accent)` | Correct answer bar color |
| `--sq-bar-track` | 10% of `--sq-text` | Bar track background |
| `--sq-border-radius` | `0.5rem` | Border radius |

Participant widget uses `--sq-p-*` variables — see `participant/participant.css` for the full list. The participant accent (`--sq-p-accent`) defaults to `var(--sq-accent)`, so setting `--sq-accent` once themes both presenter and participant.

## Data Attributes Reference

### Question Slide

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `data-quiz-id` | Unique quiz identifier |
| `data-quiz-question` | Question text |
| `data-quiz-type` | `"choice"` (default) or `"text"` |
| `data-quiz-options` | JSON array of `{label, text, correct?}` (choice only) |

### Results Slide

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `data-quiz-results` | Quiz ID to show results for |
| `data-quiz-question` | Question text (shown as title) |
| `data-quiz-type` | `"choice"` (default) or `"text"` |
| `data-quiz-options` | JSON array of `{label, text, correct?}` (choice only) |

## Limitations

- **Two question types** — multiple choice (up to 4 options) and free text (word cloud). No ratings or scales yet.
- **Requires deployment** — the audience connects over the internet, so the presentation must be hosted, not served locally.
- **AnyCable free tier** — supports up to 2,000 concurrent connections. For larger audiences, upgrade to a paid AnyCable Plus plan.
- **No long-term storage** — quiz results persist in sessionStorage across page refreshes, but are lost when the presenter closes the tab or browser. See [Answer Lifecycle](#answer-lifecycle) for details.
- **Platform templates included** — serverless function templates are included for Netlify, Vercel, and Cloudflare Pages. Other platforms still need manual porting.

## Answer Lifecycle

There is no explicit "reset" button — answer state is managed automatically through sessionStorage and sync detection.

- **Results persist across refreshes.** Both presenter results and participant submitted answers are stored in sessionStorage, so they survive page reloads but are cleared when the tab or browser is closed.
- **Participants can change their vote** while the presenter is on the same active question. The presenter tracks per-session votes, so totals stay accurate even when someone switches their answer.
- **Answers reset automatically.** When a participant connects (or reconnects) and sees that the presenter's results show `total: 0` for a quiz, their locally stored answer for that quiz is cleared — they can vote again.
- **Starting fresh:** close the presenter tab and reopen it. Results will be empty, and any reconnecting participants will see `total: 0`, which clears their stored votes automatically.
